###Focus on features, not plumbing

## Olives is currently in Alpha version and will be officialy released by the end of march 2012.

##What Olives is

 * A JS MVC Framework that helps you focus on features instead of plumbing
 * A tool that allows you to create real time UIs using native HTML/CSS/JS, or the library of your choice
 * A light library that you can extend with your own plugins, written the way you want, with the library of your choice

##What Olives isn't

 * A graphical library with nice effects
 * A graphical library with predefined styles or UIs
 * A tool that hides the way browsers technologies work

##What can I do with Olives?

 * HTML Lists that reflect databases in real time where you just describe how you want each item to look like
 * Forms to update your databases with as few JavaScript as telling what to update
 * Define bits of UIs that you can easily reuse, assemble, or share using AMD commonJS
